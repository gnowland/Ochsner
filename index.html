    		<h2>The Mission</h2><!-- bold -->
    		<p>Whitehall's existing website was a static HTML site that Jon, one of the Managing Directors, had created in his spare time. Because Jon designed it himself he was understandably attached to the appearance of the site but was finding it prohibitively time consuming to maintain its development. Jon wanted to create a system that would allow employees with little to no knowledge of web coding languages to easily publish site content and assist with maintaining the site on a day-to-day basis.</p>
    		<h2>The Strategy</h2>
    		<p>For this project I proposed that Whitehall convert its existing static, hard-coded website to a database-driven object-oriented content management system (CMS) that would deliver content dynamically from a central database. The convenience and scalability provided by content management systems would fulfill their requirement for an easy-to-use yet powerful tool for effortlessly maintaining an active online presence.</p>
    		<h2>The Dilemma</h2>
    		<p>Because of my previous experience developing and administering complex CMS-based community websites (see <a onclick="return .box.four">UDress Magazine</a><img src="sprite" />[[Joomla logo]] and <a onclick"return .box.three">DelRide SnowCorp</a><img src="sprite" />[[drupal logo]]<img src"sprite" />/[[joomla logo]]) I was confident that I would be able to exceed Whitehall's expectations. The only real challenge I anticipated was the capability to preserve the full integrity of the original site's layout and design. Leading up to this project my chief CMS implementation technique was to install a prepackaged template to create the layout and then adjust the CSS code in order to create the desired ambiance, but because Whitehall wanted to create a customized layout this would not be an option.</p>
		    <h2>The Execution</h2>
		    <p>I chose to use Joomla CMS in the implementation of this project because of its extensible feature set and flexible structure. I created a custom PHP template from scratch using Joomla's proprietary framework, successfully preserving the layout and design of the original website while integrating the powerful Joomla content management features. Once the layout was complete I developed custom modules to automatically integrate publication of the firm's weekly newsletter, Monitoring the Markets, as well as add additional dynamic elements to support greater interactivity, better search engine optomization (SEO), faster page-loading, and a cleaner layout.</p>
		    <p>The entire Whitehall team was highly impressed by the ease of use provided by the content management system for pubishing information and the improved site structure contributed by the custom template I created.</p>
