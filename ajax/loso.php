		    <h1>LoSo/Tap the Campus</h1>
		    <h4>A location-based recommendation, notification, and rewards app for restaurants &amp; bars</h4>
		    <div class="timeline">Project Timeline: June &mdash; October 2012</div>
            </div>

            <div class="cell head mission cleft">
            <h2>the mission</h2>
    		<p>The first iteration of Tap The Campus (and later LoSo) originated while attending at the University of Delaware, where Frank Trofa and I identified that there was a major communication deficiency between local social venues and their patrons. At this time Twitter, Foursquare, and even Facebook were all still in their infancy but becoming hugely popular on campus, and bar and restaurant owners were not effective at promoting their businesses via these avenues.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="cell head strategy cright">
    		<h2>the strategy</h2>
    		<p>Frank and I began developing an app that would allow patrons to evaluate what was happening in their area all in one place. Users could check-in to a place and tell their followers what they felt about the current ambiance using logical mood icons. Users could choose to receive notifications containing that nightâ€™s specials, what events were going on, and other relevant information from their favorite bars and restaurants. Restaurant owners could manage their page on the centralized network, effortlessly allowing them to stay connected with the decentralized local community.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cell divider cfull" style="margin-top:1%">&nbsp;</div>
            <div class="cell head dilemma cleft">
    		<h2>the hurdle</h2>
    		<p>Frank and I had considerable experience creating community websites, but figuring out how to effectively market our application to both restaurateurs and the community at the same time was problematic. It became clear that it would be necessary to quickly gain a critical mass of users and venues concurrently. We needed users to entice restaurant owners, and our users needed to have access to as many bars as possible in order for the service to be useful to them. Additionally, as technology in the location space matured we were faced with fierce competition from other services with overlapping functions and much stronger market share, like Yelp and Foursquare.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="cell head execution cright">
		    <h2>the execution</h2>
		    <p>Frank and I were put into contact with Rich, owner of LoSo, after pitching our application to a start-up incubator at the Early Stage East conference in Philadelphia in the Summer of 2012. LoSo was a similar application that had established itself in the local area as the premiere service to receive notifications and earn rewards for visiting local venues. Frank and I joined with Rich to re-launch LoSo after it had become entangled in complications with predatory investors. We worked to overhaul the existing code (written in Symfony II PHP), strip down the existing application and re-launch it with more innovative features. For deploying the app we chose Amazon Web Services (S3, EC2, etc.) to host the database and provide the app with dynamic, elastic storage.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="cell divider cfull break2" style="margin-top:1%;">&nbsp;</div>
           <div class="cell head result cfull">
            <h2>the result</h2>
		    <p>We successfully re-developed much of the existing application from scratch, but further work on the project has been suspended until negotiation complications with the group of former investors who retain control of the original LoSo assets and intellectual property has been resolved. While active LoSo had over 8,000 users, all from the original test market of Philadelphia.</p>
