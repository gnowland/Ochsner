            <div class="cell head mission cleft">
            <h2>the mission</h2><!-- bold -->
    		<p>Whitehall's existing website was a static HTML site that Jon, one of the Managing Directors, had created in his spare time. Because Jon designed it himself he was understandably attached to the appearance of the site but was finding it prohibitively time consuming to maintain its development. Jon wanted to create a system that would allow employees with little to no knowledge of web coding languages to easily publish site content and assist with maintaining the site on a day-to-day basis.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="cell head strategy cright">
    		<h2>the strategy</h2>
    		<p>For this project I proposed that Whitehall convert its existing static, hard-coded website to a database-driven object-oriented content management system (CMS) that would deliver content dynamically from a central database. The convenience and scalability provided by content management systems would fulfill their requirement for an easy-to-use yet powerful tool for effortlessly maintaining an active online presence.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cell divider cfull" style="margin-top:20%">&nbsp;</div>
            <div class="cell head dilemma cleft">
    		<h2>the hurdle</h2>
    		<p>Because of my previous experience developing and administering complex CMS-based community websites I was confident that I would be able to exceed Whitehall's expectations. The only real challenge I anticipated was the capability to preserve the full integrity of the original site's layout and design. Leading up to this project my chief CMS implementation technique was to install a prepackaged template to create the layout and then adjust the CSS code in order to create the desired ambiance, but because Whitehall wanted to create a customized layout this would not be an option.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="cell head execution cright">
		    <h2>the execution</h2>
		    <p>I chose to use Joomla CMS in the implementation of this project because of its extensible feature set and flexible structure. I created a custom PHP template from scratch using Joomla's proprietary framework, successfully preserving the layout and design of the original website while integrating the powerful Joomla content management features. Once the layout was complete I developed custom modules to automatically integrate publication of the firm's weekly newsletter, Monitoring the Markets, as well as add additional dynamic elements to support greater interactivity, better search engine optimization (SEO), faster page-loading, and a cleaner layout.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="cell divider cfull break2" style="margin-top:24%;">&nbsp;</div>
           <div class="cell head result cfull">
            <h2 style="text-align:left;">the result</h2>
		    <p>The entire Whitehall team was highly impressed by the ease of use provided by the content management system for publishing information and the improved site structure contributed by the custom template. The weekly market update newsletter that I also developed using Microsoft Visual Basic and Bloomberg APIs is sent to over 1,000 investors and generates a considerable amount of traffic to the site.</p>
		    <p>Unfortunately the historical Analytics data was irretrievably lost when my administrative account was deleted.</p>

		    <h4>A location-based recommendation, notification, and rewards app for restaurants &amp; bars</h4>
		    <div class="timeline">Project Timeline: June &mdash; October 2012</div>
            </div>

            <div class="cell head mission cleft">
            <h2>the mission</h2><!-- bold -->
    		<p>The first iteration of what came to become Tap The Campus (and later LoSo) originated while attending at the University of Delaware, where Frank Trofa and I identified that there was a major communication deficiency between local social venues and their patrons. At this time Twitter, Foursquare, and even Facebook were all still in their infancy but becoming hugely popular on campus, and bar and restaurant owners were not effective at promoting their businesses via these avenues.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="cell head strategy cright">
    		<h2>the strategy</h2>
    		<p>Frank and I began developing an app that would allow patrons to evaluate what was happening in their area all in one place. Users could check-in to a place and tell their followers what they felt about the current ambience using logical mood icons. Users could choose to receive notifications containing that night’s specials, what events were going on, and other relevant information from their favorite bars and restaurants. Restaurant owners could manage their page on the centralized network, effortlessly allowing them to stay connected with the decentralized local community.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cell divider cfull" style="margin-top:20%">&nbsp;</div>
            <div class="cell head dilemma cleft">
    		<h2>the hurdle</h2>
    		<p>Both Frank and I had considerable experience creating community websites, but figuring out how to effectively market our application to both restaurateurs and the community was at the same time was problematic. It became clear that it would be necessary to quickly gain a critical mass of users and venues concurrently. We needed users to entice restaurant owners, and our users needed as many bars as possible in order for the service to be useful to them. Additionally, as technology in the location space matured we were faced with fierce competition from other services with overlapping functions and much greater market share, like Yelp and Foursquare.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="cell head execution cright">
		    <h2>the execution</h2>
		    <p>Frank and I were put into contact with Rich, owner of LoSo, after pitching our application to a start-up incubator at the Early Stage East conference in Philadelphia in the Summer of 2012. LoSo was a similar application that had established itself in the local area as the premiere service to receive notifications and earn rewards for visiting local venues. Frank and I joined with Rich to re-launch LoSo after it had become entangled in complications with predatory investors. We worked to overhaul the existing code (written in Symfony II PHP), strip down the existing application and re-launch it with more innovative features. For deploying the app we chose Amazon Web Services (S3, EC2, etc.) to host the database and provide the app with dynamic, elastic storage.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="cell divider cfull break2" style="margin-top:24%;">&nbsp;</div>
           <div class="cell head result cfull">
            <h2 style="text-align:left;">the result</h2>
		    <p>Although we were able to successfully re-develop much of the existing application from scratch, after performing extensive market research and negotiating with former investors it became clear that the market for location-based applications was not receptive of new entrants. Additionally, the investors who retained control of the existing assets were not interested in divesting their shares, effectively freezing further work on the project.</p>
