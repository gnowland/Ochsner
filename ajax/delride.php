		    <h1>DelRide SnowCorp</h1>
		    <h4>A not-for-profit ski &amp; snowboard club for Delaware Valley-area college students </h4>
		    <div class="timeline">Project Timeline: February 2007 &mdash; May 2010</div>
            </div>

            <div class="cell head mission cleft">
            <h2>the mission</h2>
    		<p>DelRide SnowCorp was formed in 2001 as a group of University of Delaware students who shared a passion for skiing and snowboarding. I ran for and was elected to the position of Web Chairman as a freshman, the youngest member of the board. I was extremely eager to accept the role and start building web applications to enhance the organization’s membership and involvement.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="cell head strategy cright">
    		<h2>the strategy</h2>
    		<p>My foremost intention was to create a website where club members could <i>connect</i>… to build an online community that would strengthen member’s relationships with the organization and each other, to encourage member participation and interaction, and to facilitate the rapid delivery of important information. I would provide club members with the ability to create user profiles, upload photos, find, register, and pay for events electronically, and participate in club discussions. I also wanted to boost new member acquisition by using videos, pictures, and activity news to entice non-members to join.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cell divider cfull" style="margin-top:1%">&nbsp;</div>
            <div class="cell head dilemma cleft">
    		<h2>the hurdle</h2>
    		<p>Before becoming DelRide’s Web Chair my previous experience was developing websites using HTML and CSS, but I recognized that I would have to utilize advanced web programming techniques like PHP and database scripting in order to create the community network I envisioned. I began studying how to design and develop online communities and immediately became attracted to the power and flexibility that content management systems provided for handling complex relationships amongst large amounts of data.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="cell head execution cright">
		    <h2>the execution</h2>
		    <p>I started development on the Drupal CMS framework, coding and installing extensions that used database calls and dynamic page creation techniques to capture, process and deliver information to each user independently. I built an interactive calendar for displaying important club information (upcoming meetings, trips, social events, etc.), created galleries to showcase user’s pictures, curated a message board to allow club members to easily connect with each other, and built a multifaceted system for creating, promoting, and joining carpools to local resorts so members could easily find people to ski and ride with.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="cell divider cfull break2" style="margin-top:1%;">&nbsp;</div>
           <div class="cell head result cfull">
            <h2>the result</h2>
		    <p>Almost immediately after the website was launched the club started to see a fundamental shift in its social fabric. The facilitation of online interaction outside of club-sponsored events attributed to the strengthening of the organization’s fellowship. This stronger member engagement resulted in improved event attendance and increased member sign-ups. Existing members who may have felt isolated before were now more comfortable participating in social events, and new members joined because of the club’s increased prominence in the community. Keeping up with club affairs became effortless, and because I established online transaction processing, running and joining club events was easier than ever. Club membership surged from just 40 to over 160 members, and the year after the launch of the new website we expanded to include nearby colleges in our club outings. I was elected to club president after holding the position of web chair for two years, but continued to be closely involved in the enhancement of the site’s features.</p>
